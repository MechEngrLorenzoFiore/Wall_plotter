# Wall_plotter

This repository contains the software part of my own version of the famous Wall-plotter project.

The hardware basically consists of a drawing device 
(pen, pencil, spray can, I even though of using photoluminescent panels and a LED ligth)
hanging from two ropes connected to two different rotors.
